## Description

This is a simple 1 suit (spades) spider solitaire which was made famousby microsoft back when I was a kid. So i recreated it with Vue.js as a side-project inspired by [AadumKhor](https://github.com/AadumKhor) .

## Future scope

I have made seperate files for rules on dealing cards,card selection and other stuff for each type of Solitaire eg:- 1 suit spider, 2 suit spider, traditional solitaire. I will be working on them to make it available for every type of solitaire.
