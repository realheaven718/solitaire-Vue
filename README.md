## Description

Solitaire implemented by scratch on vue.js. It contains 3 types of solitaire namely spider(which was made famous by microsoft back when I was a kid) ,spider 4 suit and klondike. I've learned web development myself without any course or coaching so don't expect too much from the source code xD.

**This project is inspired by [AadumKhor](https://github.com/AadumKhor) Go check out his flutter implementation of the same [Here](https://github.com/AadumKhor/Solitaire_Flutter)** .
